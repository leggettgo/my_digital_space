        <h2>A Preface</h2>
        <p>It's not crucial that you know who I am to read the content on this site. 
        I am primarily writing this as an exercise for myself, to put into words how 
        I currently view Alex. It also provides context for how I arrived at the creation 
        of this site, so if that interests you please read on!
        </p>
        <h2>About Me (Alex, he/him)</h2>
        <p>I grew up in South London in the midst of a large and close family which 
        provided familiar comfort and indeed my first ever friends. This experience of 
        strong community would inspire me to look for similarly reliable networks throughout 
        my life, and I still struggle to feel content with my own company in times when 
        these are absent. My parents valued education and work, while I valued pleasing 
        others, so I was suitably studious in school and performed well against the 
        metrics of the British schooling system. 
        <br><br>I don't feel defined by my career or my education, but I suppose I will 
        say I studied Geology at a London university and went on to work for 5 years in 
        the Catastrophe Modeling field of Insurance. External positive feedback and the 
        false perception of social value I got from working a secure job with a good salary 
        is the primary reason for my extended corporate stay, despite the bureaucracy, 
        dogmatic hierarchies, and questionable ethics around the business model. Still, 
        I count myself lucky to have learnt what I do and do not value about the current 
        system of work in such a privileged way.
        <br><br>At a confluence of some incredible new friendships and a job role with 
        less oversight, I began to see the world and my position in it through a different 
        lens. My career became secondary to the time I put into developing strong relationships 
        and rethinking the existing connections around me. I learnt more about the 
        tight-knit web of injustices that keep our lauded civilised society afloat, and 
        with this knowledge my desire for change outgrew my want for corporate stability. 
        In 2024 I happily moved with my partner from London to Amsterdam where 
        they were to start a Masters programme; it was an incredible opportunity to physically 
        and ideologically cut ties with my current life structure.
        <br><br>I am writing this section five months into living in the Netherlands, 
        having struggled with my identity without a job title and navigated loneliness
        in the absence of a large part of my support network. Talking therapy, taking care 
        of physical health, and of course slowly meeting more wonderful people that I can 
        call my friends has eased the chaos of the transition. By chance and after many
        determined but unsuccessful attempts I am now exploring a career in a deep interest
        of mine, as well as contributing in a small way to a vision of community through food.
        <br><br>Unlearning the habits and perceptions I have developed from a young age does 
        not come easily, however I now welcome the opportunity to be shown a new critical view 
        of ideas or systems I assumed benign. I have realised there is no 'perfect' purpose, 
        occupation, or belief, but with the intention to support and show compassion to 
        others one can contribute to a kinder world. That is the person I would like to 
        be.
