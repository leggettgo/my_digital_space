        <p><em>May 16, 2025</em></p>

        <p>I am quite accountable to myself, but I am <em>very</em> accountable to others. 
        Fortunate enough to have supportive friends around me, I have been able to use 
        this feeling of accountability to a mutually beneficial advantage on many occasions. 
        It has helped me achieve athletic goals, keep valuable habits, learn new skills, 
        and build this website.
        </p>

        <p>The name accountability buddy brightens up my day. To me, this is a person who 
        is supporting you in an endeavour by checking in, offering feedback, and simply 
        existing as someone who knows of your goals. I think this is a truly beautiful thing, 
        which not only encourages personal growth, but strengthens comradery and community.
        </p>

        <p>If you haven't yet, get yourself an accountability buddy.</p>

        <p>I know this is a bastardisation of the Confused Spiderman meme, but in the moment 
        this was giving me strong accountability buddy energy</p>
