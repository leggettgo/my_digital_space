        <p><em>May 18, 2025</em></p>

        <p>I am quite accountable to myself, but I am <em>very</em> accountable to others. 
        Fortunate enough to have supportive friends, I have been able to use this feeling 
        of accountability to a mutually beneficial advantage on many occasions. 
        It has helped me achieve athletic goals, keep valuable habits, learn new skills, 
        and build this website.
        </p>

        <p>The words <em>accountability buddy</em> brighten up my day. To me, this is a person that 
        supports you in an endeavour by checking in, offering feedback, and simply 
        existing as someone who knows of your intentions. I think this is a truly beautiful thing, 
        which not only encourages personal growth, but strengthens comradery and community.
        </p>

        <p>If you haven't yet, get yourself an accountability buddy.</p>
