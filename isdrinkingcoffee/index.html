        <p><em>March 26, 2025</em></p>

        <p>In 9th century Ethiopia, a curious goatherd named Kaldi decided to taste a fruit that seemed to be 
        energising their flock. They soon discovered that these red cherries kept them up into the early 
        hours, and so presented them to the local monastery for use in late night devotions and prayers. 
        Or so the legend has it.</p>

        <p>We will never know who brewed and sipped the first cup of coffee, but we can say with some certainty 
        that its storied past begins in Ethiopia, continues into Yemen and then throughout the Arabian 
        Peninsula. That it has been both lauded and disowned by various cultures and religions for its psychoactive 
        qualities, and that the transportation of a single plant and even a single seed have been responsible for 
        its proliferation in Southeast Asia and the Americas. So shoutout to Kaldi for discovering some mysterious 
        cherries that would become the source of one of the world's most consumed beverages (and least regulated 
        recreational drugs).</p>
            
        <p>Like nearly everyone else in the West who grew up with this drink so accessible, I knew nearly 
        nothing about coffee, apart from that my brother told me <em>"Drink it black, otherwise you don't 
        like coffee, you just like milk and sugar"</em>. McDonald's ad campaigns claiming 'Quality coffee shouldn't 
        cost a fortune', Pret A Manger's 99p filter, and an entire aisle decked out with cheap grounds in all 
        UK supermarkets led me to believe that I was <em>owed</em> affordable access to this product.</p>
            
        <p>Then, in 2022, I saw a friend pay ‚Ç¨14 for a bag of whole beans at a caf√© in Madrid, after having a 
        longer conversation with the barista than I had ever entertained. Detailed on the packaging was the 
        country of origin, altitude, and farm where the coffee was grown, as well as the bean variety, 
        processing type, and flavour notes. It was <em>specialty</em> coffee, they said. This information meant nothing 
        to me, and in all honesty when they kindly brewed me a cup I didn't find it particularly special or 
        exciting. It was black coffee, just like I'd always had, and coffee is coffee. Right?</p>
            
        <p>The seed was planted, however, and steadily bloomed over the next couple of years. I began buying beans from 
        specialty cafes and brewing them at home with a hand grinder and AeroPress. I no longer haphazardly gulped down 
        free coffees offered in the office where I worked, or opted for the most economical option when on the go. 
        Drinking coffee transformed from a casual habit for productivity to a careful ritual to be enjoyed with friends, 
        where I would take pleasure in each sip to identify the notes of <em>'stone fruits'</em> and <em>'strawberry gelato'
        </em>. I connected with specialty coffee on an ideological level, understanding that this industry moved towards 
        direct relationships with and better pay for farmers, and away from the speculation-based commodity pricing model.</p>
            
        <p>Reading about and working in specialty coffee I have come to understand that buying expensive beans from a 
        third wave caf√© is not a fix-all for the issues within the coffee industry. While the ideal is an equitable 
        and sustainable relationship with happy and autonomous farmers, capitalism always finds a way to strong-arm 
        in some bullshit. I have learnt about the rich white men that buy up coffee farms in Panama, the coffee 
        futures market that seems to always turn a profit for Western importers while producers rarely set their 
        own price, and the pressure put on farmers to cater to the latest trends in 
        <a href="https://www.rawmaterial.coffee/news-insights/the-anoxic-water-pillow-technique" target="_blank">
        anoxic water pillow fermentation</a> from the demanding specialty consumer. Coffee is also inseparable from 
        the colonial history of trade and cruel exploitation in plantations, and it is one of many industries that 
        continues to contribute to the economic disparity between the Global North and South.</p>
            
        <p>And in spite of all of this, I have fallen in love with this beautiful bean and it's many intriguing facets. 
        The expression of biology in its processing, physics in its brewing, and chemistry in its taste provide 
        almost bottomless rabbit holes to explore. For now, I would love to continue to work 
        toward change in this imperfect industry.</p>
            
        <p>I want to always be critical of the things I engage in, and along with its many shortcomings I do believe 
        that specialty coffee opens up paths for redemption. One impactful way it achieves this is by creating a 
        more conscious consumer. Unlike most of the products we buy (then eat, lose, break, return, waste, forget 
        about), we are <em>encouraged</em> to engage with the supply chain by familiarising ourselves with the country of 
        origin, the processing method, the farm and perhaps even the farmer. Then there is the intentionality in the consumption 
        of the product. The coffee ritual I mentioned before really does represent the attitude for many people who 
        brew coffee at home. You grind the beans, take care in the brewing, and focus diligently on the flavours that 
        have been hinted at on the label. In my opinion, this is quite an incredible thing - imagine a world in which 
        we took such care and interest with everything we spent our money on.</p>
