        <p><em>February 9, 2025</em></p>

        <p>The <em>Asterix</em> comic series was a staple bedtime and bathroom read of
        my early childhood. I look back on the racist depictions with distaste 
        (<a href="https://library.nashville.org/blog/2019/08/tackling-racism-childrens-books-what-asterix-taught-me-about-parenting" 
        target="_blank">more on this here</a>), however the word play in the character 
        names is a treasure of the stories that sticks with me still. Getafix 
        the druid, Unhygienix the fishmonger, and Cacofonix the ill-talented 
        bard all paled in comparison to my favourite animal companion Dogmatix, 
        an orbital and subtly pivotal character in each story. This English 
        translation is an even more fitting title than the original French name 
        Id√©fix, which plays on the expression <em>id√©e fixe</em> (fixed idea).</p>

        <p>Far from the quirky, loyal and stubborn character in those stories, 
        dogmatism itself is a trait I find worrying and far too easily adopted. 
        It underlies the principles of conservatism - keeping things the 
        same because they have been kept the same - an ideology that stifles 
        progress and upholds many violent social hierarchies. As an individual 
        it is also easy to be held back by your own deep rooted beliefs.</p>
            
        <p>A profound change I made at the round age of 20 was 
        to follow a vegan lifestyle. The decision came from a slew of research into 
        food systems, climate change, and animal ethics. Why, then, did I have 
        such a strong opinion about the importance of consuming meat prior to 
        this, when I had done nothing to inform that behaviour? Looking back it is 
        easy to see the impact of British cultural normalisation and a pressure 
        to conform to masculine stereotypes. Upbringing and environment were my 
        biggest enablers.</p>
            
        <p>Going vegan felt incredibly liberating. I had an informed and renewed autonomy 
        over a huge aspect of my lifestyle, and knew that my choices benefited other 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI" target="_blank">earthlings</a>. 
        I found much more joy in food and my cooking improved dramatically as 
        I experimented with new and complex plant based recipes. However, I increasingly 
        started to see the topic as black and white. I struggled to understand why 
        everyone couldn't peek behind the proverbial curtain and make the change 
        themselves. Relationships were put under strain and social scenarios around 
        food became awkward. The dogma had returned.</p>
            
        <p>The years since then have given way to more important perspective 
        shifts, and each learning experience has emphasised the nuance of the 
        previous. I am still an ethical vegan and hold many strong beliefs that 
        shape my life, but I have slowly removed the sense of finality around 
        them. For veganism this involves the understanding that morality is 
        subjective (although I do think that most people share a similar moral 
        framework and it is largely ignorance that does not move the needle on 
        this issue). It is important to me that the ideas I give weight to do not 
        crush my critical consideration of new and conflicting information. 
        I <em>want</em> to learn and I <em>want</em> to change, because I know the 
        world is not static.</p>
