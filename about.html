        <h2>A Preface</h2>
        <p>It's crucial that you know 'who' I am to read the content on this site. 
        I am primarily writing this as an exercise for myself, to put into words who I 
        think I am. It also provides context for how I arrived at the creation of this 
        site, so if that interests you please read on!

        <h2>Me (Alex) (he/him)</h2>
        I grew up in South London in the midst of a large and close family which 
        provided familiar comfort and indeed my first ever friends. This experience of 
        strong community would inspire me to look for similarly reliable networks throughout 
        my life, and I still struggle to feel content with my own company in times when 
        these are absent. My parents valued education and work, while I valued pleasing 
        others, so I was suitably studious in school and performed well against the 
        metrics of the British schooling system. 
        <br><br>I don't feel defined by my career or my education, but I suppose I will 
        say I studied Geology at a London university and went on to work for 5 years in 
        the Catastrophe Modeling field of Insurance. Positive feedback of a secure job 
        with a good salary (and a lack of critical thinking on my part) are the primary 
        reasons for my extended corporate stay, despite the bureaucracy, dogmatic 
        hierarchies, and questionable ethics around the business model. Still, I count 
        myself lucky to have learnt what I do and do not value about the world of work 
        in such a privileged way.
        <br><br>At a confluence of some incredible new friendships I began to see the world 
        and my position in it through a different lens. My job became secondary to the time 
        I put in developing strong relationships and rethinking the existing connections 
        around me. I began to learn about the tight-knit web of injustices that keep our 
        lauded civilised society afloat, and with this knowledge my desire for change 
        outgrew my want for corporate stability. In 2024 I happily joined moved with my 
        partner from London to Amsterdam where they were to start a masters; it was an 
        incredible opportunity to physically and ideologically cut ties with my current 
        life structure.
        <br><br>I am writing this section five months into living in the Netherlands. 
        Unlearning the habits and perceptions I have developed from a young age is not 
        easy, however I now welcome the opportunity to be shown a new critical view of 
        something I assumed benign. I have realised there is no 'perfect' purpose, 
        occupation, or belief, but with the intention to support and show compassion to 
        others one can contribute to a kinder world.
