        <p><em>May 23, 2025</em></p>
        <p>I've been reading a lot of science fiction recently. Whether it's the interstellar world building 
        of space operas like the <em>Dune</em> or <em>Foundation</em> series, or the advent of advanced biotech 
        in Dogs of War, the genre remains a beautiful source of inspiration and wonder for me. Seeing that the 
        fields of robotics, telecommunications, and space travel have all been significantly influenced by 
        concepts great sci-fi writers have dreamt up tells me that I'm not alone in my fascination.
        </p>
        
        <p>Last week, in an effort to redirect my reading from awe and imagination to some serious stone cold 
        learning, I picked up <em>Women, Race & Class</em> by Angela Davis. Ten pages into the visceral 
        account of the enslaved black woman's experience in 18th Century American plantations, a familiar 
        chorus of upset, anger, and disgust rose up in me. That same week, I participated in local actions 
        for Palestine, set in motion the start of a political book club with a colleague, and spent a lot of 
        energy exploring these amped up feelings to those close to me who I know share similar ideologies.
        </p>

        <p>This experience was not new. I remember it from attending a screening of <a href="https://www.landofhopeandglory.org/"
        target="_blank"><em>Land of Hope and Glory</em></a>, whilst reading Akala's <em>Natives: Race and Class in 
        the Ruins of Empire</em>, and in the days following October 7th, 2023. All of these moments 
        led me to dial up my knowledge of and engagement with current political issues. That week was the most 
        politically focused I have been since my arrival in Amsterdam nine months ago, even though I had the 
        intention of at a minimum participating in local activist projects here. So why, since my perspective on 
        these causes has not changed, do I let my attention fade away?
        </p>

        <p>Reflecting on my life during these months, I can identify a few systems that are invested in my 
        political disengagement.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Capitalist Fatigue</strong><br>I am not alone in working a physically and mentally demanding 
        job. I can often be stretched for time in the mornings and drained in the evenings. I prioritise 
        sleep in order to work well, and fill much of my free time with life admin that I can't take care of 
        during the nine-to-five. This does an incredible job of keeping me politically inert. Where is the 
        time or energy to focus on societal issues around this work on which I rely to live?
        </p>

        <p><strong>Individualism</strong><br>An unspoken encouragement to put my myself first. 
        I am rewarded with social and economic capital on my personal wins, which can largely revolve around my 
        position, responsibilities, and salary. Even during the time I spent carefully considering my career path, 
        my persistent job search was underlined with a subconscious competitive desire to rise above my imaginary 
        rival applicants. Meanwhile, I have seen collective action acknowledged and praised far less than someone 
        who has (against the odds or not) become financially successful in their own right.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Sedative Comfort</strong><br>I like my treats, goddammit. Watching films, eating good food, 
        visiting new places, buying that matt black temperature controlled gooseneck kettle I've always wanted. 
        My desire for material comfort is <em>strong</em>, and when I have this I am left with a convincing sense of 
        security and fulfilment. Even with intentional gestures of ethical consumption and donations to nonprofits 
        I can be found under the convincing spell of 'doing enough'. This keeps me at a suitable separation from 
        exploring the discomfort and unrest that is necessary to enact meaningful change in the world.
        </p>

        <p>So, I have awoken from this slumber of inaction. That's awesome, and I will strive to put my energy to 
        good use. But these sneaky forces are patiently waiting to bring me back under, aren‚Äôt they? The cycle 
        of learning, feeling, forgetting, and returning might be inevitable, but I can certainly put in 
        place some habits to help keep this proverbial flame alive. The importance of exposing myself to emotional 
        catalysts* like <em>Women, Race and Class</em> is apparent. As is the benefit of having <a href="/isaccountable" target="_blank"> 
        accountability buddies</a> around me who I can discuss these feelings and participate in actions with. 
        If those fail, I am also writing on this experience to keep a neat record that I will be prompted to reflect 
        on when I start a new post on <em>Gaming the Career Ladder and Retiring Early</em> in a couple of years' time (please no).
        </p>

        <p>*I need to acknowledge that ‚Äòemotional catalysts‚Äô for me are lifelong struggles for much more vulnerable people. 
        The importance of action is highlighted by the very fact that I can enjoy the privilege of looking/reading/speaking 
        on these issues as an observer.</p>

        <p>Thank you Angela Yvonne Davis for the wake up call. Free Palestine!</p>
