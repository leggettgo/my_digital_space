        <h1>Why I Started This Site</h1>
        <p><em>Published on February 9, 2025</em></p>

        <p>The comic series Asterix was a staple bedtime and bathroom read of 
        my early childhood. I look back on the racist depictions with distaste 
        (link to article on this), however the word play in the character 
        names is a treasure of the stories that sticks with me still. Getafix 
        the druid, Unhygienix the fishmonger, and Cacofonix the ill-talented 
        bard all paled in comparison with my favourite animal companion Dogmatix, 
        an orbital and often times pivotal character in each story. The English 
        name is an even more fitting title than the original French name Idéfix, 
        which plays on the French expression idée fixe (fixed idea).</p>

        <p>Far from the quirky, loyal and stubborn character in those stories, 
        to be dogmatic is a trait I find worrying and far too easily adopted. 
        It underlies the principles of conservatism - keeping things the 
        same because they have been kept the same - an ideology that stifles 
        progress and upholds many violent social hierarchies.</p>
            
        <p>As an individual level it is easy to be held back by your own deep 
        rooted beliefs. A profound change I made at the round age of 20 was 
        to follow a vegan lifestyle. The choice followed a slew of research into 
        food systems, climate change, and animal ethics. Why, then, did I have 
        such a strong opinion about the importance of consuming meat prior to 
        this, when I did nothing to inform that behaviour? Looking back it is 
        easy to see the impact of British cultural normalisation and a pressure 
        to conform to masculine stereotypes; upbringing and environment were my 
        biggest enablers.</p>
            
        <p>Going vegan felt incredibly liberating. I had autonomy over a huge 
        aspect of my lifestyle, and knew that my choices benefited other 
        earthlings. However, I started to see things increasingly as black and 
        white. I couldn't understand why everyone couldn't follow this path onto 
        the other side of the curtain. Relationships were put under strain and 
        social scenarios around food became awkward. The dogma had returned.</p>
            
        <p>The years since then have given way to more important perspective 
        shifts, and each learning experienced has emphasised the nuance of the 
        previous. I am still an ethical vegan and hold many strong beliefs that 
        shape my life, but I have slowly removed the sense of finality around 
        them. For veganism this involves the understanding that morality is 
        subjective (although I do think that it is largely ignorance that does 
        not move the needle on this issue). It is important to me that the ideas 
        I give weight to do not crush my critical consideration of new information. 
        I want to learn and I want to change, because I know the world is not static.<p>
